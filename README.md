# CSE 490g1 / 599g1 Homework 1 #

Welcome friends,

For the second assignment we'll be implementing two core building blocks to deep learning, convolutional layers and maxpooling layers.

You'll have to copy over your answers from the previous assignment, `matrix.c`, `activations.c`, and `connected_layer.c`.

## 5. Convolutions ##

### 5.1 `im2col` ###

### 5.2 `col2im` ###

### 5.3 `update_convolutional_layer` ###

## 6. Maxpooling ##

### 6.1 `forward_maxpool_layer` ###

### 6.2 `backward_maxpool_layer` ###

## Turn it in ##

First run the `collate.sh` script by running:

    bash collate.sh
    
This will create the file `submit.tar.gz` in your directory with all the code you need to submit. The command will check to see that your files have changed relative to the version stored in the `git` repository. If it hasn't changed, figure out why, maybe you need to download your ipynb from google?

Submit `submit.tar.gz` in the file upload field for Homework 0 on Canvas.
